Improves the UI for WordPress's built-in post formats.

== Description ==

This plugin is intended to improve the usability of WordPress's built-in Post Formats feature exclusively through some
key changes in design.

The unhelpful list of radio buttons is replaced with with Retina-compatible icons, format titles, and brief, helpful
descriptions of each format. Instead of dramatically changing the way WordPress works, Better Formats simply tries to
make the existing WordPress Post Formats feature more friendly and informative.

Additional user-centric improvements are planned. This initial release is intended to help spur conversation about Post
Format improvements currently being considered for WordPress core.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I make the Post Formats box smaller? =
Once you're comfortable with Post Formats, you can disable the additional description text from WordPress settings.
From your WordPress admin, simply go to Settings > Writing and check the box next to "Hide descriptions in the Post
Format box". This will hide the extra description text and the Formats box will take up less space.

== Screenshots ==
